# jasdjames-codingQuiz-javascript-1

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to create a coding quiz using things that I have learned in last month in coding bootcamp. The project asked 5 coding questions of the user. The project was fun and educational. I believe it defiantly raised morale and gave me a little more confidence in finding the solutions on my own.

## Usage 
This quiz asks 5 coding based questions of the user. The quiz is timed. The quiz takes off 10 seconds if a question is missed. If time runs out the quiz jumps to the score page. The score is displayed and there is a place for the user to place their initials and the score.

## Credits

Will Utterback helped me with the time function as well as talked me through some of my some of my concerns about my code. Office hours after class was also very helpful. The Colorsplosion Timer may have been the most helpful activity
